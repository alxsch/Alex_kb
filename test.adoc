AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation,
articles, books, ebooks, slideshows, web pages, blogs and UNIX man
pages.  AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including
HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.  AsciiDoc is highly configurable: both the
AsciiDoc source file syntax and the backend output markups (which can
be almost any type of SGML/XML markup) can be customized and extended
by the user.

[WARNING]
This user guide is for AsciiDoc.py, which is a legacy processor for
this syntax, handling an older rendition of AsciiDoc. As such, this
will not properly handle the
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.asciidoc[current AsciiDoc specification].
It is suggested that unless you specifically require the AsciiDoc.py
toolchain, you should find a processor that handles the modern
AsciiDoc syntax.
